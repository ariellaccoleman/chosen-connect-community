# Modular Structure Migration Plan (COMPLETED)

> **NOTE: This migration plan is now COMPLETED and should be ignored going forward. All future structural changes should follow the current repository pattern as documented in `src/api/core/repository/repository-refactor.md`.**

This document outlines the plan that was used for migrating the codebase from a monolithic structure to a more modular organization.

## Current Status

All phases completed! The codebase now has:

1. ✓ New modular structure fully in place
2. ✓ All components updated to use the consolidated hook structure
3. ✓ Unified error handling system implemented
4. ✓ Toast system consolidated
5. ✓ Legacy API files removed or replaced with clean forwarding modules
6. ✓ All deprecated hook files removed and imports updated to modular structure

## Phase 1: Deprecation Notices (Completed) ✓

- [x] Mark legacy files with `@deprecated` JSDoc tags
- [x] Add documentation for preferred import patterns
- [x] Create migration plan document
- [x] Add README files to document module structure

## Phase 2: Deprecation Warnings (Completed) ✓

- [x] Add runtime console warnings in development mode for deprecated imports
- [x] Document preferred import paths
- [x] Create clean redirection files for backward compatibility

## Phase 3: Legacy API Clean-up (Completed) ✓

**Goal**: Remove deprecated API files and update imports.

**Tasks**:
- [x] Update any remaining imports from legacy API files
- [x] Deprecate older API files including:
  - [x] `src/api/organizationsApi.ts`
  - [x] `src/api/core/apiFactory.ts`
- [x] Fix TypeScript errors in repository pattern implementation

**Benefits**:
- Smaller codebase
- Clearer API surface
- Improved maintainability
- Consistent API usage patterns

## Phase 4: Hook Import Standardization (Completed) ✓

**Goal**: Standardize all hook imports to use the modular structure.

**Tasks**:
- [x] Fix errors in legacy hook compatibility layers
- [x] Update relationship mutations to use proper API functions
- [x] Fix type errors in RepositoryQuery interfaces
- [x] Update backward compatibility layers for organization hooks
- [x] Update components using legacy hooks like `useOrganizationAdmins.ts`
- [x] Ensure all imports use the modular structure (e.g., from `@/hooks/organizations`)
- [x] Remove remaining legacy hook files after updates
- [x] Update test files to use the new import patterns
- [x] Create a central export file for hook factory functions

**Benefits**:
- Consistent import patterns
- Better code organization
- Improved discoverability of hooks
- Smaller bundle sizes through tree-shaking

## Phase 5: Repository Pattern Enhancement (Completed) ✓

**Goal**: Enhance the repository pattern for data access.

**Tasks**:
- [x] Ensure consistent use of the repository factory pattern
- [x] Consolidate repository utilities
- [x] Create documentation for the repository pattern
- [x] Standardize error handling in repositories
- [x] Improve typing of repository interfaces

**Benefits**:
- More consistent data access patterns
- Better testability of data access code
- Improved error handling for API calls
- Clearer separation of concerns
